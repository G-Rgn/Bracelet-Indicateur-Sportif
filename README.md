# LilyGo_ESPNOW
### Informations
Through this manual, we will trace the steps that allow us to quickly arrive at the same result as the product we have. This is a tutorial that is meant to be as detailed and efficient as possible in order to avoid wasting any time in reworking the project.  
This work is the result of an adaptation and improvement of existing code. We started from the version of the code of the product [LILYGOÂ®TTGO](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-T-Wristband) as well as those of the sensor MAX30102.  
It should be noted that this sensor does not have a green LED, which impacts the measurement of heart rate. This may be an important part for future improvement.  
For any information that could not find its source here, do not hesitate to consult the codes that have served as a starting point.
